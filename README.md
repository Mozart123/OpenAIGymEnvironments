# OpenAIGymEnvironments
I created simulations for 2 dynamical systems for a project.

gymenv is for a robot arm consisting of a mechanical subsystem and an electronical subsystem.

gymenv1 is for a robot arm with damping.

In my project, I am making a stable adaptive control system using multiple neural networks. I will share its code when finished.
